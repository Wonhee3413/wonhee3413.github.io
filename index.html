            <p>Hello, I am Wonhee! I am majoring in computer science ,and this is my second year at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. 
               I transferred this fall quarter from a university in Wiscondin. I was born in Pohang, South Korea and moved to Incheon, where
               international aiport is located. My hobby is watching a movie and my favorite genres are horror, thriller, and mistery.
               The reason why I like horror/mystery movies is because their plot is often unpredictable and surprising.
               If you are interested in watching horror movies, I recommend Gone Girl, The Call, and The Conjuring.
            </p>
            <p>The specific field that I work on in the future is data science. I have always liked to collect and organize data.
                It is amazing that I can make a conclusion and predict the future based on what I have collected. I am planning to take 
                related courses from next year so that I can get a job in the field of data science. I am also interested in AI
                since it is closely related to data scinece. I hope this website helps me learn about me!
